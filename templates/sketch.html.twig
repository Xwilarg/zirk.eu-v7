<h2>Showcase</h2>
<p class="explanation">
  It's a bit hard to showcase programming stuff because when you play a game it's easier to say 'the graphic style is pretty' or 'the game idea is nice' than 'this algorithm is well made'<br/>
  That's why I made this little group of project (only one there so far) to attempt to showcase technical stuff that are only programming related
